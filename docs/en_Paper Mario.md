# Paper Mario

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is 
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they 
would in the vanilla game. You will also be given a Homeward Shroom as a key item which you can use at any time to 
return to your spawn location.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Shuffled items can include those received from NPCs or found in chests, blocks, trees, bushes, or free-standing in the 
overworld. Optionally, you can shuffle partners, gear, star pieces from hidden panels, letter rewards, 
partner upgrades, and more.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

All items, minus a few consumables which need to be in replenishable locations in your game so you can access them if 
you lose them.

## What does another world's item look like in Paper Mario?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by the Present item.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

For consumables, you will get the item as if you'd found it in the field, and have the opportunity to manage your 
inventory if necessary. For other items, you will not receive any sort of notifications; the item will just appear in 
your inventory. You only receive items while in the overworld and unpaused. You receive one item per second or so, so it 
may take a bit for items to show up in your inventory if receiving several items at once.
