This is not necessarily a strict roadmap, nor is it exhaustive of everything that there is to do. 

### Necessary for Alpha
- ~~Output of a patch file that applies the desired settings, randomized items, locations, etc.~~
- ~~Set up a way to communicate with an AP server for sending/receiving items.~~

### Pre-Early Alpha
- ~~Logic helpers to account for access rules that change depending on settings~~
- ~~Logic helper to determine when to grant Parakarry check~~
- ~~Logic for keysanity option: false~~
- ~~Logic for gear shuffle options: vanilla and gear_locations~~

### Early-Mid Alpha
- ~~Super blocks and multi-coin blocks as potential locations, as well as being able to shuffle them~~
- ~~Bowser Castle Mode (change entrances, remove locations)~~
- ~~Power Star Hunt (logic, items, remove locations in ch8 if skipped)~~
- Entrance Randomizer
- ~~Require Specific Spirits~~
- ~~Limit Chapter Logic~~
- ~~Open World settings~~

### Mid-Late Alpha
- ~~Enemy difficulty~~
- ~~Consumable item pool randomization~~
- Item traps
- ~~Start with random items~~
- Random puzzles
- ~~Mystery shuffle~~
- ~~Formation shuffle~~


### Late Alpha - Early Beta
- ~~Prevent Chapter 8 locations from holding too many progression items (OoT does similar with Ganon's Castle)~~
- ~~Create yaml file using PMR settings string~~
- Offworld consumables
- Item get animations
- Offworld item sprite
- Offworld item names and descriptions
