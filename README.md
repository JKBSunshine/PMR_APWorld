# Paper Mario 64 AP World
This is the AP World for Paper Mario 64 to be used in [Archipelago.](https://archipelago.gg/) It is in a playable, **alpha** state. Some things will work, some things will not. Things that do work might not work in a way that you would expect from a fully completed AP World. 

Please report any issues you encounter in the dev-multiplayer channel in the Paper Mario Randomizer Discord or the Paper Mario thread in the Archipelago Discord's future game design forum. Be careful using different settings that may not be fully implemented yet, as it may result in unbeatable seeds, game crashes, or generation failures.

## Setup

View the setup guide [here.](https://github.com/JKBSunshine/PMR_APWorld/blob/main/docs/setup_en.md) Along with general setup, it will include details on what settings should or should not be used. Before tweaking the base YAML, please refer to the setup guide to save yourself from trying a setting that isn't implemented.

## Quick Notes

- Receiving consumables will cause an item get animation similar to what you'd get if you found it in the world. Manage your inventory carefully.
- Receiving non-consumable items does not have any animation; items will simply appear in your inventory.
- Off-world items do not clarify what the item is or who it belongs to in game; you will have to look at your client to see what you have sent and to who.
- Off-world items in shops and Merlow's rewards have the item and player names shown so that you know what you're buying. The font color for the item roughly matches the default font colors for progression, filler, traps, and useful item classifications.
- Refer to the [PMR Wiki](https://github.com/icebound777/PMR-SeedGenerator/wiki) for help for Paper Mario Randomizer, such as commonly missed locations, general tips, and more.
